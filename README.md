# 🎸 Workenizer

> *ROW ROW ROW your CODE, into a bitstream...*
> *Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily — life is but a scheme.*
> *For those about to rock... we salute your layout.*

---

**Workenizer** is a VS Code extension that automatically arranges your multi-folder workspace into a clean, structured two-column layout:

* 📁 Left: `main.sh` and `README.md` for each folder
* 📄 Right: Preview of each `README.md`
* 🎹 Rows correspond to each workspace folder (alphabetically)

---

## ✨ Features

* 🧠 Automatically detects folders in `.code-workspace`
* 🪄 One-command layout (keyboard shortcut: `Cmd+Shift+L`)
* 📑 Closes all existing tabs before arranging
* 🎸 Displays a rock-themed status bar message on activation

---

## 🚀 Usage

1. Open a multi-root workspace with folders like:

   ```
   z/
   taku/
   update/
   ```
2. Press `Cmd+Shift+L` (or run “Workenizer: Arrange Workspace as Rows” from the command palette).
3. Watch your editor organize itself like a backstage crew at a rock concert.

## 🎯 Roadmap Ideas

* Save/load layout presets
* Allow custom file targets per folder
* Support horizontal/vertical layout modes
