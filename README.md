**Workenizer** is a VS Code extension that automatically arranges your multi-folder workspace into a clean,
structured two-column layout:

- 📁 Left: `main.sh` and `README.md` for each folder
- 📄 Right: Preview of each `README.md`
- 🎹 Rows correspond to each workspace folder (alphabetically)

---

## ✨ Features

- 🧠 Automatically detects folders in `.code-workspace`
- 🪄 One-command layout (keyboard shortcut: `Cmd+Shift+L`)
- 📑 Closes all existing tabs before arranging
- 🎸 Displays a rock-themed status bar message on activation

---

## 🚀 Usage

1. Open a multi-root workspace with folders like:

   ```
   z/
   taku/
   update/
   ```

2. Press `Cmd+Shift+L` (or run “Workenizer: Arrange Workspace as Rows” from the command palette).
3. Watch your editor organize itself like a backstage crew at a rock concert.

---

## 🎯 Roadmap Ideas

- Save/load layout presets
- Allow custom file targets per folder
- Support horizontal/vertical layout modes

> _For those about to rock... we salute your layout._
